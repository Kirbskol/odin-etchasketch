# odin-etchasketch

This relates to the second JS project within the Foundation course of The Odin Project.

The aim is to create a version of Etch-a-Sketch which allows user to set a grid between 16x16 up to 100x100.
The user should be able to select any color to use, and also have the option of a "Rainbow" effect color.
There is also a Reset button incorporated which when pressed clears the canvas.
